  <div class="anschreiben">
    <p>Two years ago, I accidentally saw an ad of the "call for code", which is an IBM public welfare project. In this project, people can really help some people who need help through software development. I just learned that the power of software
      is so powerful that it can affect and help a lot of people in reality. Thinking of my side, it is now full of various software. I use them to schedule my life, and to communicate with family and friends. Software is magical, and every line of
      code
      seems to be full of charm. So I started to learn how to program and how to make the ideas in my heart into a realistic and feasible program. From the beginning of learning python, and using python for some simple text processing, to the
      opportunity later in a company, using C # and ASP.Net Core for back-end development. I also encountered many difficulties. But now I am a software developer. This means I need to understand the problems and solve them.
      I want to make the program more efficient and easy to use through my own efforts. At the same time, I hope that I can help others through my ability. For example, call for code now has projects to help fight corona virus.
      If your company needs me too, please contact me.</p>
